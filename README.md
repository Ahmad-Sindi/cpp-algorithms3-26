# Algorithm Challenge #26 – Upper & Lower Case String Conversion (Level 3)

🧠 **Problem Description**
-
This challenge focuses on string manipulation in C++.  
The program reads a full string from the user, converts all characters to uppercase,
then converts the same string to lowercase and prints the results.

Example:
-
Input:  

Hello World

Output:  

HELLO WORLD  

hello world

💡 **What You’ll Learn**
-
- Iterating through strings character by character
- Using built-in character functions (`toupper`, `tolower`)
- Understanding ASCII-based character transformation
- Writing reusable and clean string-processing functions
- Applying algorithmic thinking to text manipulation problems

---

🧩 **Algorithm Concept**
-
This problem emphasizes **linear traversal algorithms**, where each character
is processed independently in sequence.  
It reinforces the idea that strings are simply arrays of characters that can be
systematically transformed using loops.

💬 **Notes**
-
This is a foundational challenge for mastering string handling in C++.  
It prepares the learner for more advanced problems such as parsing, validation,
and text-based algorithms.
